-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decogo 1.0   23 Nov 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CG Algorithm:
- Sub-problem: removed the feature that adds integral penalty term in 
    the objection function of sub-problems; deleted pyomo model that has integral 
    penalty terms in objective; removed adding compact pricing cut whn solving
    MINLP sub-problem; removed convex hull projection sub-problems
- IA master problem: removed the feature of fixing columns 
    in certain blocks; deleted pseudo z and columns that were used for column 
    fixation; removed the feature for setting perturbed objective function in 
    IA problem.
- NLP projection master problem: removed the features such as 
    trust region, solution with perturbation, multi-objective terms.
- MIP project master problem: removed the features such as 
    partial block integer fixation before solving, multi-objective terms.
- Removed heuristic Outer Approximation master problem and related methods
    for computing convex hull cuts and their update.

Removed DIOR algorithm (partition-based heuristic):
- Removed algorithm class which stands for DIOR
- Removed cells and related containers


Removed implementation of OA algorithm for nonconvex problems using DC 
(difference of convex functions) decomposition

Removed saved logs of classical OA (without decomposition) and SCIP
Removed very simple example of energy model with sub-blocks
