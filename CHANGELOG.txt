Decogo CHANGELOG
===============

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decogo 2.0   Dec 2022
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Refactory of CG Algorithm:

- Subpackage decogo.problem now only stores modules of IA master problem
(based on Pyomo) and other general containers that manages any type of sub-problems,
primal heuristics for the original problem and approximation data.

- Pyomo-based problems related to sub-problems and primal heuristics are moved
to Subpackage decogo.pyomo_problem to keep the old version of CG algorithm and a new
algorithm called DBCG running

- Added Module decogo.model.input_model_base containing abstract classes for
implementing general input model that contains user-defined sub-problems and
primal heuristics

- Added Subpackage decogo.pyomo_input_model that constructs a Pyomo-based MINLP input model
that includes Pyomo-based sub-problems and Pyomo-based primal heuristics.

- Added Module decogo.solver.refactory_colgen that can take general input model and solve
using CG algorithm; added testing examples in tests.solver.refactory_colgen.pyomo_MINLP
that solves Pyomo-based MINLP problems with given Pyomo-based MINLP input model.


Add DBCG Algorithm:

- Added Module decogo.solver.dyn_block_colgen that implements dynamic block and
column generation algorithm

- Extended IA master problem: extended the IA master problem in the CG algorithm by
adding inner approximation of newly generated hyper-blocks, converges to an overlapping
convex hull relaxation of the original problem.

- Sub-problem: added sub-problem solving for hyper-blocks, added hyper-block sub-problem
instances in containers PyomoSubProblems and PyomoDecomposedProblem during the running
of DBCG algorithm.

- Approximation data: extended the data structure of columns and points to add new
hyper-blocks and the corresponding extended (long) columns and points.

- Decogo process and setting file: updated setting and decogo process module to include
options and parameter settings for running DBCG Algorithm to solve Pyomo-based MINLP
problems.

Decogo 1.0   23 Nov 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CG Algorithm:
- Sub-problem: removed the feature that adds integral penalty term in 
    the objection function of sub-problems; deleted pyomo model that has integral 
    penalty terms in objective; removed adding compact pricing cut whn solving
    MINLP sub-problem; removed convex hull projection sub-problems
- IA master problem: removed the feature of fixing columns 
    in certain blocks; deleted pseudo z and columns that were used for column 
    fixation; removed the feature for setting perturbed objective function in 
    IA problem.
- NLP projection master problem: removed the features such as 
    trust region, solution with perturbation, multi-objective terms.
- MIP project master problem: removed the features such as 
    partial block integer fixation before solving, multi-objective terms.
- Removed heuristic Outer Approximation master problem and related methods
    for computing convex hull cuts and their update.

(difference of convex functions) decomposition

Removed saved logs of classical OA (without decomposition) and SCIP
